          At age 16, I took a career compatibility quiz for school. I had two careers which I was almost 100% compatibile with, the first one
          being "Software Engineer". Laughing at my results, I printed the report, put it in a file, and moved on. Fast forward 10 years, I am now a graduate of the Thinkful Fullstack Engineering Program, and
          continuing my education. I have never been more proud of my work and excited for the future.
