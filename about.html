      I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Full Stack Web
      Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. I am based out of the
      Portland, Oregon area. I love my Jeep, my Camera, and my Netflix account.
      I am dedicated to continued learning and using my skills to further my
      career in Web Development. When I am not buried in my laptop coding,
      learning, or digitally restoring old family photos, I spend my time with
       my wonderful Dog & Cat.
